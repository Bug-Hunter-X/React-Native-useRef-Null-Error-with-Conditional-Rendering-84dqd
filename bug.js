This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that has conditional rendering.  The problem stems from referencing the element before it's mounted, resulting in a null value.  This often happens when trying to access a ref inside a function that's called before the component's render lifecycle completes.

```javascript
// Buggy component
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // This might run before the component is mounted and myRef.current is null
    console.log(myRef.current); // Potential error
    if (myRef.current) {
      myRef.current.focus();
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      {someCondition && (
        <Text ref={myRef}>Focus me</Text>
      )}
    </View>
  );
};
```
